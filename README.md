## Overview

It is a command-line interface (CLI) utility tool designed to facilitate a simplified and streamlined onboarding process for Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE). With just a click and the right CLI flags, you can install your chaos infrastructure with ease.

This tool is not just about easing the onboarding process; we have developed it to seamlessly integrate with your AWS account and conduct HCE experiments. Configuring and authenticating HCE with AWS can be a complex multi-step process, but with `onboard_hce_aws`, we significantly reduce this complexity.
